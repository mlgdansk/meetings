What we would like to do is to build mapping $f$ that will approximate the very process we observed. \n",

    "### What is ResNet?\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet is a network architecture introduced in 2015, taking _deep_ in deep learning to a whole new level. The motivation behind creating this network is highly empirical - creators (not only them) observed issue the named _degradation problem_. The observed that adding layers not only does not improve the overall accuracy of the network but worsens it. That implies that added layers are not able to learn even identity function - which would be enough to keep accuracy on the same level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set that ordered set of layers should should learn some function $g$. If our net is able to learn how to approximate this function then it should be able to learn how to approximate residual function $f(x) = g(x) - x$. From that we have $g(x) = f(x) + x$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residual Block\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual block can be considered as a mini neural net, where _input of this net is also added to the output of the net_. We may think about it as:\n",
    "$$fr^l(x) = f(x) + Wx$$\n",
    "Where $l$ represents a number of layers in a mini neural net. $W$, on the other hand, is a matrix that allows simple linear transformation, for example, to make \"dimensions compile\". Usually, it's just an identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ResNet as Euler Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "Now... let's get back to ODEs. One of the simplest approaches to numerically solve ODE is _Euler's Discretization_. Idea behind this method goes as follows:\n",
    "1. Consider $y' = f(x, y)$ given initial condition $y_0 = y(x_0)$\n",
    "2. Let's suppose our step size is of size $t$. We will use this value to update value of $x$: $x_{n+1} = x_{n} + t$.\n",
    "3. From definition of derivative we have $y' = \\frac{\\Delta y}{t}$, simple manipulation gives us $\\Delta y = tf(x_n, y_n)$\n",
    "4. From everything above we get $y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta y$ and $y_{n + 1} = y_n + tf(x_n, y_n)$.\n",
